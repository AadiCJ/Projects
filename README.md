# Projects
My large projects that I am working on in high school. All will have a jar file if you want to test them out.

# Structure
The completed folder has all my finished projects\
All other folders are work in progress projects.\
If you want to try them out, download the .zip file and navigate to the required .jar file.\

# Todo 
all .jar files need to be placed in one folder\
some .jar files have to be added.
